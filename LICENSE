Notes on licensing:

It seems the author below me, carl, completely jacked up the git history.
We can't see how much of the code if any pre April 9th 2017 is his or not his.
He also changed the license for ??? reason. He seems to have manually included the
license as written by Todd Eddy. So we could reason that the "first commit" which
is a good chunk of the repo is where Todd's commits end. But then - did Carl rebuild
the commit history under his authorship? Are all of the changes except the last commit
Todd's? I have no idea. It's a mess.

I'm relicencing and I'm going to go ahead and write off the below intermediary
GNU licencing as a blip in the matrix. Byeeeeeeee.
